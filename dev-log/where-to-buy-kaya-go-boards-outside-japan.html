        <h1>Where to Buy Hon Kaya Go Boards and Clamshell Stones If You're Outside Japan</h1>
        <p>If you love Go and dream of owning a handcraft Hon-Kaya table or floor board, living outside Japan does not have to stop you. High-quality kaya boards can be purchased internationally. You just need to know where to look and what to prepare for.</p>
        <p>I've personally bought Go boards, stones, and bowls from all of the sources below. The products were excellent across the board, and international shipping was smooth with a bit of preparation.</p>

        <h2>1. en.goboard-stone.co.jp (Kiseido / Go Board &amp; Stone)</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.goboard-stone.co.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open website →</a></p>
        <p>This English-friendly store is one of the easiest entry points for overseas buyers. They offer a solid range of kaya boards, shin-kaya boards, stones, and bowls, with clear descriptions and international shipping experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's good:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>English website and communication</li>
            <li>Reliable packing and shipping</li>
            <li>Consistent quality across boards and stones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If this is your first time importing a kaya board, this is a very safe choice.</p>

        <h2>2. kurokigoishiten.com (Kuroki Goishi Ten)</h2>
        <p><a href="https://kurokigoishiten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open website →</a></p>
        <p>Kuroki Goishi Ten is legendary among Go enthusiasts. Their kaya boards and clamshell stones are top-tier, traditional, and beautifully finished.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's special:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exceptional craftsmanship</li>
            <li>Authentic, traditional production</li>
            <li>Excellent stones and bowls to pair with boards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They do ship internationally, but communication may take a little more patience. If you value heritage and quality above all else, this is worth it.</p>

        <h2>3. Searching "Go Board" on eBay</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=go+board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open website →</a></p>
        <p>eBay can be surprisingly good for finding kaya boards, especially vintage or second-hand ones from Japan.</p>
        <p><strong>Tips when using eBay:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check seller ratings carefully</li>
            <li>Ask for detailed photos of grain, thickness, and condition</li>
            <li>Confirm shipping and insurance options</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've bought boards and bowls this way with great results, but it requires more careful inspection than buying from a dedicated shop.</p>

        <h2>Shipping &amp; Customs: What You Must Know</h2>
        <p>One important thing to plan for: shipping can cost up to half of the total price for a kaya board, especially thick floor or table boards. That is normal. These boards are heavy and valuable.</p>
        <p>More importantly, keep detailed records of the wood treatment and drying process (kiln-dried vs air-dried, treatment certificates, descriptions from the seller). Customs authorities may contact you to confirm this information.</p>
        <p>If you can't provide it quickly, your shipment may be delayed during customs clearance.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Buying a kaya board from outside Japan takes a bit of planning, but it is absolutely worth it. With the right seller and proper documentation, you can own a beautiful, long-lasting board that elevates every game you play.</p>
        <p>If you care about Go equipment, a hon-kaya board is not just a purchase, it is an experience.</p>
        <p>Of course, you can also experience realistic Go boards in Deep Board Go :-)</p>
