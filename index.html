    <h2>Go in 3D</h2>
    <p>Deep Board Go brings the timeless strategy of Go, also known as 围棋 / 圍棋 / 바둑 / 囲碁,
        into a beautiful, modern 3D experience. Designed for both longtime enthusiasts and curious newcomers,
        it faithfully recreates the feeling of a premium Go set with realistic stones, handcrafted board textures, and dynamic lighting that highlights every move.</p>

    <h2>Developer's Story</h2>
    <p>This project is more than just a game, it’s a passion that I’ve carried for many years. I’ve played Go for a long time, though I’m still an amateur with much to learn. Over the years, I’ve collected around 150 Go books, a Hon Kaya table board, a Hon Kaya board with legs, and several Shin Kaya boards and a board that somehow disappeared on its own :-). I’ve always been fascinated by the craftsmanship behind Go equipment. I even attempted to build my own boards, only to learn how incredibly difficult it is to achieve the perfect surface and draw grid lines.</p>

    <p>There are many excellent 2D Go programs already, and for those focused purely on the strategy, they are more than enough. But for me, the physical beauty of the board and stones is part of why Go is so captivating.
        This 3D board game has been a personal dream, a way to bring that tactile experience into the digital world.</p>


    <p>Deep Board Go is my way of sharing the joy of playing Go on a beautiful 3D board.
        There is still much to improve and refine, and I sincerely welcome your feedback.
        Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy Deep Board Go.</p>
