    <h2>Computer Go - A whole new feel</h2>
    <p>Deep Board Go brings the timeless strategy of Go, also known as 围棋 / 圍棋 / 바둑 / 囲碁,
        into a beautiful, modern 3D experience. Designed for both longtime enthusiasts and curious newcomers,
        it faithfully recreates the feeling of a premium Go set with realistic stones and handcrafted boards.</p>


    <p>There are already many outstanding online and offline 2D Go programs, perfect for players focused purely on strategy. DeepBoardGO is for those seeking a different feeling and a fresh experience. The physical beauty of Go, the weight of the stones, the grain of the board, is a big part of what makes the game so captivating. This 3D interpretation brings that tactile elegance into the digital world, letting you feel closer to the board and enriching your enjoyment of every move.</p>


    <p>There is still much to improve and refine, and we sincerely welcome your feedback.
        Thank you for reading, and we hope you enjoy Deep Board Go.</p>

    <p>We have a collection of boards in our studio, including a Hon Kaya table board, a Hon Kaya board with legs, and several Shin Kaya boards. We’ll be sharing photos of them soon.</p>
